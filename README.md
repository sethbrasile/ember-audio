#### Installation
`ember install ember-audio`

#### [Interactive Demo/Documentation](http://sethbrasile.github.io/ember-audio)

Ember Audio provides an `audio` service and various classes/mixins that make
working with the Web Audio API super EZ.

Ember Audio aims to simplify sampling, triggering, routing, scheduling,
synthesizing, soundfonts, and working with audio in general.

**Note**: Target browsers must be modern! The list of supported browsers at
the moment is pretty small. Please check http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio-api.
