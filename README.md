#### Installation
`ember install ember-audio`

#### [Interactive Demo/Documentation](http://sethbrasile.github.io/ember-audio)

Ember Audio provides an `audio` service and various classes/mixins that make
working with the Web Audio API super EZ.

Ember Audio aims to simplify sampling, triggering, routing, scheduling,
synthesizing, soundfonts, and working with audio in-general.

**Note**: Target browsers must be modern! The list of supported browsers at
the moment is pretty small. Please check http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio-api.

#### Need your help!
Please give me feedback/suggestions if you have any. Pull requests and issues
are welcome. You can also contact me on the Ember community discord: `@sethbrasile`.

Please let me know if you're building something with Ember Audio! It's a fairly
